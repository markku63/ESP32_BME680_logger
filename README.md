# ESP32_BME680_logger
Use ESP32 microcontroller to read and process data from a BME680 sensor

Uses ESP-IDF v. 4, not Arduino

Includes BME680 driver from https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BME680_driver

## TODO
- use BSEC library https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/software-tools/software/bsec/ to further process the sensor data
- use MQTT (or other protocol) to publish processed data
